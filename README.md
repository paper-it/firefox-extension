# Paper it

The extension turns colorful and distracting websites into black-and-white newspapers,
allowing you to choose what to read independently of bright covers or colorful fonts.

## Why?

Because I'm tired of the overly colorful video covers, article previews,
and eye-catching font colors that distract from the main content.
I don't want to turn off thumbnails on YouTube, and I don't want to hide images.
I just want to choose the order of viewing the content myself, because my attention belongs to me.

## Demo

| Before                                                | After                                               |
